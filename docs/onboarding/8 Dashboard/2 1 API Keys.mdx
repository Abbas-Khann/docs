The settings tab allows you to configure and create API keys. An API key is required to use thirdweb's infrastructure services such as Smart Wallet, Storage and RPCs.

## Creating an API Key

To create an API key, 
- Click the button labeled "Create API Key"
- Enter a name for the key. The name is used to identify the key in the list of API keys. 
- Select the services that the key will have access to
    - [Storage](/storage)
    - [Smart Wallet](/wallet/smart-wallet) - you will need to add the smart wallet addresses which will be allowed to use this API key.
    - RPCs
- Click the "Create" button to create the key.

This will create an API key that you can use to access thirdweb's infrastructure services by copying the Publishable Key and instantiating the thirdweb SDK:

```javascript
const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK("goerli", {
        apiKey: "pk-7bdfc499fbdd4678687ae5d6fe68dbd5a761559ceaa176e3"
    });
```

### Publishable Key

The publishable key is used to access thirdweb services from the browser. It is safe to share this key with anyone as it can be restricted to allowed domains and enabled services. 

To restrict the publishable key to a domain, enter the domain in the "Allowed Domains" field. You can add multiple domains by separating them with a comma.

:::info
This Publishable Key can be used from any domain. Anyone with the key can use it to access all the services enabled for this key.
:::

### Secret Key

The secret key is also used to access thirdweb's infrastructure services but it is not safe to share this key with anyone. It does not adhere to the restrictions you define. Anyone with the Secret Key can access all thirdweb services.

To generate a secret key, click the "Generate" button.

This will generate a secret key that you will need to copy and save in a safe place. You will not be able to view the secret key again.

If you suspect that your secret key has been compromised, you can regenerate the key by clicking the "Regenerate" button. This will invalidate the old key and generate a new one.
