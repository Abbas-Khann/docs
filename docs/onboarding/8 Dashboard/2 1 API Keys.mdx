# API Keys

The settings tab allows you to configure and create API keys. An API key is required to use thirdweb's infrastructure services such as Smart Wallet, Storage and RPCs.

An API key is made up of two parts:

- **Client ID** - This key is used to access thirdweb's infrastructure services and identifies your application. It can be restricted to allowed domains and enabled services.
- **Secret Key** - This key is used to access thirdweb's infrastructure services by identifying and authenticating your application from the backend. It is not safe to share this key with anyone. It does not adhere to the restrictions you define. Anyone with the Secret Key can access all thirdweb services.

## Creating an API Key

To create an API key:

- Click the button labeled "Create API Key"
- Enter a name for the key. The name is used to identify the key in the list of API keys. 
- Select the services that the key will have access to
    - [Storage](/storage)
    - [Smart Wallet](/wallet/smart-wallet) - you will need to add the smart wallet addresses which will be allowed to use this API key.
    - RPCs
- Click the "Create" button to create the key.

This will create an API key that you can use to access thirdweb's infrastructure services by copying the client id and instantiating the thirdweb SDK:

```javascript
const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK("goerli", {
        clientId: "your-client-id"
    });
```

:::warning
It will also generate a secret key that you will need to copy and save in a safe place. **You will not be able to view the secret key again**.

### client Id and Secret Key

The client id is used to access thirdweb services from the browser. It is safe to share this key with anyone as it can be restricted to allowed domains and enabled services. 

To restrict the client id to a domain, enter the domain in the "Allowed Domains" field. You can add multiple domains by separating them with a comma.

:::info
This client id can be used from any domain. Anyone with the key can use it to access all the services enabled for this key.
:::

The secret key is used to access thirdweb services from the backend. It is not safe to share this key with anyone. It does not adhere to the restrictions you define. 

:::warning
Once your API key has been created, you will not be able to view the secret key again. If you lose the secret key, you will need to create a new API key.

Anyone with the Secret Key can access all thirdweb services so store it in a safe place.

### Revoking an API Key

To revoke your API key, click the "Revoke" button. This will invalidate the key and it will no longer be usable. You can regenerate the key to create a new one.
